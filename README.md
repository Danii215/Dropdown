## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Development tool
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Organizing and making the code sustanaible
-   [Sass/Scss](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

As my third project with typescript and react (the second time in a vite context), this was pretty easy to do, and made in just a few hours. I admit I didn't took time like I did for the other projects, but it's still looking good anyways!

### Continued development

I might come back to this project to implement a real SSO with login and account creation, along with the other tasks presented in the header.
